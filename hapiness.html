   <h3>Stress of poverty linked to psychological changes</h3>
  <center> <img src="img/Mary.jpg" title="Mary" align=center; width=70%; /></a></center>
<p>
  Story written by Madeline Jarrard.</p>
<p>
  COLUMBIA — The stress of poverty — worrying about housing, wondering about the likelihood of a next meal, tabulating a meager income against mounting expenses — isn’t hard to imagine. Over time, though, that anxiety can cause subtle changes in the brain.</p>
<p>
  Poverty is linked to a reduced attention span and limited ability to multi-task, which add to the numerous obstacles faced by those who struggle financially, according to a 2013 study published in in the academic journal Science. Poverty, the researchers wrote, “captures attention, triggers intrusive thoughts, and reduces cognitive resources.”</p>
<p>
  The study indicated that the implications of poverty are more substantial than a lack of money − they relate to the functionality of one’s brain. The researchers found a correlation between the stress of poverty and poor decision-making. Cognitive capacity is the amount of information one can retain, and those living in poverty suffer from a “tunneling effect.”</p>
<p>
  Teri Roberts is the Asset Development coordinator for Central Missouri Community Action. At the center, she teaches a variety of finance education classes, including budgeting.</p>
<p>
  “Our clients are low income, so they struggle to meet basic needs,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>
  Roberts teaches students to manage the money they have and to live on a budget. There are many people who don’t know basic financial information, she explained.</p>
<p>
  But Roberts does more than teach finances. She explained that the general mindset of people who enter the class is they “can’t even pay the bills, much less save money.”</p>
<p>
  But this mindset is tangible for all people.</p>
<p>
  According to the study, financial concerns have a cognitive impact comparable with losing a full night of sleep. Researchers cited that the effect of poverty is similar to a drop in cognitive ability by 13 IQ points.</p>
<p>
  The goal is to avoid the “poor decision making” that poverty threatens.</p>
<p>
  Roberts finds simple ways to encourage better spending habits. “We all have money we fritter away,” she said. She calls it “fritter finder,” where people find things in their lives that are not necessities. She gives the examples of lottery tickets and other expenses that add up.</p>
<p>
  The change that Roberts makes is tangible. There were pre and post assessments taken of individuals who took the budgeting class. Of the 20 to 25 people analyzed, the difference before and after the class was substantial. Roberts cited an 89 percent increase in knowledge demonstrated by the tests.</p>
<p>
  Mary Taylor, 36, participated in the budgeting class when she was unemployed and low on money.</p>
<p>
  “I wasn’t doing near as good as I thought I was,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>
  Taylor, who had Roberts as a teacher, explained how helpful it was having a budget plan.</p>
<p>
  “I definitely felt more confident,” she said.</p>
<p>
  Now, Taylor works for Central Missouri Community Action at the office in Boone County.</p>
<p>
  Angela Hirsch, the Community Services Director, explained more about the goals of the classes.</p>
<p>
  The budgeting classes at Central Missouri Community Action help teach people to best utilize the money they do have. Instructors help their students create a path to their goals: buy a house, go to college, or simply live within their means.</p>
<p>
  But for some, the goals come in small steps.</p>
<p>
  The penny roundup is another way the instructors teach how to save money. Individuals are taught to save the coin change from all of their purchases. For example from a $9.50 purchase one could pay with $10 and save the 50 cents.</p>
<p>
  “That starts to add up,” Hirsch said.</p>

   <h3>Motivation to volunteer comes from within</h3>
  <center> <img src="img/Food lines.jpg" title="Volunteering" align=center; width=70%; /></a></center>
<p>Story written by Cullen Ecoffey.</p>
<p>
COLUMBIA —  Stephanie Tovar and Jason Bradshaw have to experience the realities of food insecurity every day.
</p>
<p>
Tovar is self-employed and has recently had to rely on The Food Bank For Central and Northeast Missouri, recently to put food on the table for her kids. According to the food bank, one in six people in the region is food insecure.
</p>
<p>
“It’s good to have places like this ‘cause people don’t have what they need,” said Tovar.
</p>
<p>
Jason Bradshaw also agrees that the food pantry is quite helpful, but he uses it to stretch his monthly income. By getting bread and dairy products at the food bank, he can use his money elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s great like the program and everything,” Bradshaw said. “I mean there’s probably more people more deserving than me but I mean I use it to help fill the plate.”

</p>
<p>
Although they might not have much, people like Stacey Woelfel make it possible for organizations like the food bank to help those in similar situations as Tovar and Bradshaw.
</p>
<p>
Woelfel has been on the food bank’s board for 19 years and has donated both his time and money to it. He says his donating isn’t always for just to help others.
</p>
<p>
“We give for ourselves,” he said. “We say, ‘Boy I don’t have to go to bed hungry tonight.’ The notion of giving in that case is to share the stuff I have, to help them.”
</p>
<p>
By providing food for the kids, the bank also is able to impact the kids beyond ending their immediate hunger.
</p>
<p>
“A dollar invested in an early childhood nutrition program in a developing country could potentially return at least three dollars worth of gains in academic achievement, and perhaps much more,” according to the Journal of Public Economics.
</p>
<p>
When kids aren’t hungry, it gives them the ability to perform at a higher level and overcome their economic restrictions.
</p>
<p>
The food bank provides help to about 114,000 people a month, but without the donations of both time and money to it, many more people would go hungry.

</p>
<p>
“We are drawn in by the need,” Woelfel said. “Most of us don’t go to bed hungry, and through volunteering, I feel I’m doing my part to help and fix that for people.”
</p>
<p>
The food bank’s mission is sharing food and bringing hope to Mid-Missouri. Food Bank Communications Coordinator Mike DeSantis said that giving is a privilege.
</p>
<p>
“If you’re doing something to help others, and you’re not enjoying it, you’re doing it wrong.”
</p>
<p>
It’s this sort of attitude toward giving that helps charities survive. And, according to Woelfel, at the end of the day his giving hardly impacts his pocketbook.
</p>
<p>
“I have a chance to give up a little bit of time or money that I’m not going to miss very much,” said Woelfel. “Obviously that’s a big motivation.”</p>
