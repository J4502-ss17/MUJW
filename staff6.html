     <h5>Tensions surround Mormon response to gay marriage ruling</h5>
     <p>When the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints mandated that any adolescent with gay parents be denied membership.</p>
     <p>This led to riots and protests outside the White House in Washington, D.C.</p>
     <p>In order to participate in church activities, the child had to proclaim that gay marriage is unjust and a sin. Some members resigned from the church, while others approved the new rule.</p>
     <p>“I think it’s honestly so stupid to talk about things you have no knowledge about and to protest against things that you think are gross or not normal,” said Madison Rollins, a 16-year-old Mormon from Springville, Utah.  </p>
